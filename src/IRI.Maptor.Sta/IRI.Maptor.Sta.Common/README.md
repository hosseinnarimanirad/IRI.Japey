# IRI.Maptor.Sta.Common

The **IRI.Maptor.Sta.Common** project is the foundational building block of the **Maptor GIS library suite**. It provides core abstractions, utility classes, mathematical models, data structures, and essential helpers required by higher-level Maptor components. This library ensures consistency and reusability across all GIS-related modules.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This library focuses on:

* **Core interfaces and abstractions** for domain-driven design (e.g., `IIdentifiable`, `IPoint`)
* **Mathematical operations** including linear algebra and statistics
* **Advanced data structures** (trees, heaps, disjoint sets)
* **Unit and measurement conversions** (linear, angular)
* **Extensions and helpers** for strings, numbers, collections, and I/O
* **Service models** for integration with external APIs (Google, Bing, Here, Mapzen)

It acts as the **backbone for Maptor**, ensuring other projects share a unified and optimized base.

## ✨ Features

* **Abstractions** for geometric and domain models
* **Encodings** (Base64 URL, Persian DOS)
* **Enums and attribute utilities**
* **Rich set of data structures**: binary heaps, trees, interval trees, red-black trees, disjoint sets
* **Helpers** for I/O, JSON, XML, HTTP, security, randomness
* **Mathematics**: matrices, vectors, eigenvalues, chi-square, statistics models
* **Unit conversions** for angles and lengths (meters, feet, miles, etc.)
* **Extensions** for `string`, `DateTime`, `IEnumerable`, `int`, `double`, etc.
* **External service contracts** for routing, geolocation, and dictionary services

## 📚 Installation

Install via **NuGet**:

```powershell
Install-Package IRI.Maptor.Sta.Common
```

Supports **.NET 8.0 and later**.

## 🔄 Example Usage

### Working with Points and Bounding Boxes:

```csharp
using IRI.Maptor.Sta.Common.Primitives;

var pointA = new Point(10.5, 20.3);
var pointB = new Point(12.7, 22.1);

var bbox = new BoundingBox(pointA, pointB);
Console.WriteLine($"Bounding Box: {bbox}");
```

### Using Unit Conversions:

```csharp
using IRI.Maptor.Sta.Common.Units.Linear;

double meters = 1000;
var miles = new Mile(meters);
Console.WriteLine($"{meters} meters = {miles.Value} miles");
```
