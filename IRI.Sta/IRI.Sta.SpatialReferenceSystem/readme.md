# üåê IRI.Sta.SpatialReferenceSystem

**A .NET library for advanced spatial reference systems (SRS), geodetic transformations, and map projections**

Provided SRSs are based on horizontal spatial reference systems introduced in geodesy. Including main category of terresterial, celestial and orbital coordinate systems including

- Terrestrial Coordinate Systems
  - Conventional Terrestrial (CT or AT)
  - Instantaneous Terrestrial (IT)
  - Geodetic (G)
  - Local Geodetic (LG)
  - Local Astronomic
- Celestial Coordinate Systems
  - Apparent Places (AP)
  - Right Ascension (RA)
  - Horizontal Angle (HA)
- Orbital Coordinate Systems
  - Orbital (OR)

## üìå Core Features

### 1. Support different Map projections and horizontal datums
Map projections such as TM, UTM, Mercator, WebMercator, Cylindrical Equal-area, Albers Equal Area Conic and Lambert Conformal Conic with 1 parallel and 2 parallel are supported. Also many ellipsoids have been defined as horizontal spatial datum.

### 2. Comprehensive Coordinate System Transformation Support
Transformation between different spatial reference systems are available including:
- CT <-> IT
- CT <-> G
- G1 <-> G2 (transform Geodetic system with different ellipsoids)
- CT <-> LA
- G <-> LG
- LA <-> LG
- LA <-> HA
- HA <-> AP
- IT <-> AP
- OR <-> AP
